# GreenEBT

This is your guide to New York City Farmers' Markets that accept EBT cards. As EBT recipients and lovers of healthy and fresh foods, we struggled to find local farmers' markets that accept EBT cards. So we decided to create GreenEBT, an EBT Farmers' Market Finder that connects EBT recipients to local farmers' markets.

## Getting Started
